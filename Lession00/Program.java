/* This is a long comment
   This is an example of a minimal correct program (that compiles) but cannot be run by the interpreter
   1) The class name and the file name are not the same
   2) The class has no main entry point
 */
class Program {
	// This is a short comment
}
// Compile this program like so:
//    javac MinimalNotWorking.java
// Try to run it as follows:
//    java MinimalNotWorking
// What does it happen?

/*
   Try to change this file name into Program.java.
   The interpreter `java` will change the type of error.
   Now it will tell you that he cannot find the main entry point
